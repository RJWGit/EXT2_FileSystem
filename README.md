# About
An EXT2_Filesystem is a linux filesystem that was used in the 1990s. My project takes an EXT2 filesystem, mounts it, then you're able
to use common Linux commands such as, mkdir, rmdir, ls, cd, cat, and etc to interact with the mounted filesystem. This was a project I did for
my systems programming class where we were required to write all commands ourselves to get a deeper understanding of C and how filesystems work.
